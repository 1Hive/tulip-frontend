In updateIndex, the Index\n  implements its CRDT logic: add, remove or update items in the data\n  structure. Each new operation received from the operations log is applied\n  in order onto the current state, ie. each new operation changes the data\n  and the state changes.\n\n  Implementing each CRDT as an Index, we can implement both operation-based\n  and state-based CRDTs with the same higher level abstractions.\n\n  To read the current state of the database, Index provides a single public\n  function: `get()`. It is up to the Store to decide what kind of query\n  capabilities it provides to the consumer.\n\n  Usage:\n  ```javascript\n  const Index = new Index(userId)\n  ```\n*/\n\nclass Index {\n  /*\n    @param id - unique identifier of this index, eg. a user id or a hash\n  */\n  constructor(id) {\n    this.id = id;\n    this._index = [];\n  }\n  /*\n    Returns the state of the datastore, ie. most up-to-date data\n    @return - current state\n  */\n\n\n  get() {\n    return this._index;\n  }\n  /*\n    Applies operations to the Index and updates the state\n    @param oplog - the source operations log that called updateIndex\n    @param entries - operations that were added to the log\n  */\n\n\n  async updateIndex(oplog, entries) {\n    this._index = oplog.values;\n  }\n\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Index;","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
